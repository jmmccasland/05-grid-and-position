            <p>Army had half a day. I'm a monster. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Guy's a pro. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. I care deeply for nature. Really? Did nothing cancel? I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. Steve Holt! I've opened a door here that I regret.</p>

            <p>By day two, I had a better expectation of how each day should go and a better work ethic that provided me the luxury of small breaks between stretches of writiing code. The assignment for the day required us to create a page called Popular Github. It reinforced the understanding of inline and block element's default property and the inline-block display property.</p>
            <p>Additionaly, we were able to begin working with the double conainer method of html markup and I got a bit overwhelmed by all of the divs inside of divs, inside of divs, inside of divs, inside of divs, inside of divs, inside of divs, inside of divs, inside of divs, inside of divs.</p>

            <p>Day one of the Iron Yard was a stressful one. Not because of the firehose of information being shot full blast at my face but because I was maybe taking it too seriously. I was expecting it to be much more uptight and not nearly as welcoming. I felt super prepared from the pre-work but nothing could prepare for the task of combing through my instructors code which was purposefully destroyed for me to fix. Of course I over thought it and made it much more difficult but with some time and a few breaks I was able to figure it out.</p>
            <p>Luckily, there was a bit of pattern to it and the only major task was to find the syntax errors in the CSS then match the classes in the CSS to the HTML elements that needed their properties. It would have been impossible without the design prompt though!</p>
