            <p>The last assignment of the week required yet another grid layout using position, display, and calc widths. All things that have effectively since been eliminated by flexbox. They all still have their use but grid making has become a quick and easy thing thanks to flexbox!</p>
            <p>I enjoyed the octocat drawings and the confidence in HTML and CSS positioning and layout. It was an nice change of pace from the OverWatch layout.</p>

            <p>Near the end of day 3, was it day 3? The days are all running together and all I'm doing is coding. I don't know anymore. We were assigned a cool project in which we were required to code the layout for Overwatch's heads up display at some point though.</p>
            <p>It was a fun assignment and sparked my interest in Overwatch. I've never played but I watched some of the character bio videos they made and it seems really interesting! This is the one project so far where I was able to come close to completing the Hard Mode version of the assignment and I even made a tutorial on how to do it: <a href="http://codepen.io/jmmccasland/pen/QdxraL">here</a></p>

            <p>By day two, I had a better expectation of how each day should go and a better work ethic that provided me the luxury of small breaks between stretches of writiing code. The assignment for the day required us to create a page called Popular Github. It reinforced the understanding of inline and block element's default property and the inline-block display property.</p>
            <p>Additionaly, we were able to begin working with the double conainer method of html markup and I got a bit overwhelmed by all of the divs inside of divs, inside of divs, inside of divs, inside of divs, inside of divs, inside of divs, inside of divs, inside of divs, inside of divs.</p>

            <p>Day one of the Iron Yard was a stressful one. Not because of the firehose of information being shot full blast at my face but because I was maybe taking it too seriously. I was expecting it to be much more uptight and not nearly as welcoming. I felt super prepared from the pre-work but nothing could prepare for the task of combing through my instructors code which was purposefully destroyed for me to fix. Of course I over thought it and made it much more difficult but with some time and a few breaks I was able to figure it out.</p>
            <p>Luckily, there was a bit of pattern to it and the only major task was to find the syntax errors in the CSS then match the classes in the CSS to the HTML elements that needed their properties. It would have been impossible without the design prompt though!</p>
